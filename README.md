# Server-monitoring

## Metrix to be monitored :-
 1. CPU Utilization
 2. Memory Utilization
 3. Process/Services Monitoring
 4. Event Log Monitoring

## Monitoring tools :-

Â Blow tools can be used to monitor the server metrix
 1. Nagios
 2. Grafana
 3. Dynatrace
 4. Cacti

* If the server is hosted on cloud then we can use the below monitoring tools

 5. Cloudwatch AWS
 6. Azure monitor


## Challenges :-

* Make sure the client and server agents are up and running (eg : xinetd or snmp for nagios) and restart incase if the service is down using Ansible
* SMTP issues -- alers are not sending as email, this also can be fixed by restarting the SMTP service using Ansible
* SMS and e-mail alerts for warning and critical alerts.
* Raise ticket with the concerned team automatically and set the priority
* Review threshold and monitoring regularly to optimize the alerts

* Spin-up a new server if the threshold is reaching 80 % if the server hosted on cloud
